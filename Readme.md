# Best cafes of Beirut

This app lets you see the best cafes of Beirut and get access their names, locations, Zomato ratings and personnal comments from me

## How to open the page:
To open the page, simply open "web map.html" with a browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Safari,... )

## How to use the application:
The map shows you all the cool cafes of Beirut. You can filter them by keyword, or you can click on the cafes that interest you and see their prices  

## How the application is organized: 
The application has a few additional folders beyond "web map" and "read me": 
1. "App.js" runs all the javascript code - it's the core file that makes the app work
2. The "Images" folder is the repository for all images in the map (mostly, the images of the places)
3. The "knockout-3.4.2' is the link to the knockout library that helps the web page automatically update 

## Sources and inspirations 
The css and html from this code are inspired from the code in the udacity course on Google Maps API, although heavily modified

## Note on API keys
To allow the app to be shared, I've hard-coded my Google Maps and Zomato API keys in the solution. However, I'll remove them in the coming weeks (after Udacity Review) to avoid that the API key is overused and you might need to sign-up to get them

## Potential improvements
Multiple improvements can be considered on the application: 
- Adding other cool cafes by opening app.js and adding more cafes in the Model
- Enabling people to select favorite shops 
- Building an interface for people to add cafes
- Color coding depending on how cool the cafes are
- Linking with instagram to load their latest photos
